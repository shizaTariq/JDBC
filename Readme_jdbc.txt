JDBC API - It provides user functionality to interact with database through Java. It is a type 1 JDBC API i.e. it 
uses underlying ODBC bridge to communicate with the Database. ODBC acts as a bridge API between JDBC and Database.
Currently following interfaces have
been implemented:

java.sql.Connection;
java.sql.Driver;
java.sql.ResultSet;
java.sql.Statement;

Unit Test:
  All the implemented interface have been tested rigorously against sample jdbc test code to ensure 
correctness and completeness of JDBC API.
